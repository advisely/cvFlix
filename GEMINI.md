## 1. Solution & Software Architecture

As the **Solution Architect**, my focus is on selecting the right technologies and designing a scalable, maintainable, and robust architecture that meets all project requirements.

### Technology Stack

*   **Frontend (Public & Admin):** **React** with **Next.js 15**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Next.js provides an excellent developer experience, server-side rendering (SSR) for fast page loads and SEO benefits, and a unified framework for both the public-facing site and the backend API.
*   **UI Framework (Public):** **Tailwind CSS v4**.
    *   **Reasoning:** To achieve the unique, custom look of Netflix, a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind is ideal. It allows for rapid development of bespoke designs without being constrained by pre-defined components. We use `embla-carousel-react` for the carousel functionality.
*   **UI Framework (Admin):** **Ant Design v5**.
    *   **Reasoning:** As specified, Ant Design is used for the `/boss` admin panel. It offers a rich set of high-quality, pre-built components, perfect for building a data-intensive and functional admin interface quickly.
*   **Backend:** **Next.js API Routes** with **Prisma ORM**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Leveraging Next.js API routes keeps the entire application within a single, cohesive monorepo. Prisma provides a type-safe database client that simplifies interactions with the database and accelerates backend development.
*   **Database:** **SQLite**.
    *   **Reasoning:** A lightweight, file-based database that's perfect for this project's needs, providing reliable relational data storage without the overhead of a full database server.
*   **Authentication:** **NextAuth.js v4**.
    *   **Reasoning:** A complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It is used to secure the `/boss` admin panel with a simple username and password (Credentials Provider).

### System Architecture

The application is a single Next.js project, structured as follows:

1.  **Public-Facing App (`/`):**
    *   Rendered using Next.js with SSR for performance.
    *   UI built with React, styled with Tailwind CSS.
    *   Fetches data from the internal Next.js API.
    *   No authentication required.
    *   Features Netflix-style carousels and cards.
2.  **Admin Panel (`/boss`):**
    *   A route-grouped section of the Next.js app.
    *   Secured by NextAuth.js, redirecting unauthenticated users to a login page.
    *   UI built with React and the Ant Design component library.
    *   Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interfaces for all resume data.
    *   Includes media upload functionality and appearance customization.

### Data Model (Database Schema)

The data is modeled to represent a professional resume with comprehensive media support:

*   **`User`**: Stores admin login credentials.
    *   `id`, `email`, `passwordHash`
*   **`Company`**: Represents a unique company.
    *   `id`, `name`, `logoUrl`
*   **`Experience`**: Represents a specific role or position.
    *   `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `description`, `companyId` (links to `Company`)
*   **`Accomplishment`**: Key achievements within an experience.
    *   `id`, `description`, `experienceId` (links to `Experience`)
*   **`Skill`**: A specific skill with category and media support.
    *   `id`, `name`, `category` (e.g., "Technology", "Language")
*   **`Project`**: A project associated with an experience.
    *   `id`, `name`, `description`, `url`, `experienceId`
*   **`Education`**: Educational qualifications with media support.
    *   `id`, `institution`, `degree`, `field`, `startDate`, `endDate`
*   **`Certification`**: Professional certifications with media support.
    *   `id`, `name`, `issuer`, `issueDate`
*   **`Highlight`**: Career highlights and achievements with media support.
    *   `id`, `title`, `company`, `startDate`
*   **`NavbarConfig`**: Customizable navigation and appearance settings.
    *   Logo configuration, navigation labels, background styles, font family
*   **`Media`**: Universal media storage for all content types.
    *   `id`, `url`, `type`, linked to various content models
