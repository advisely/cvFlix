# Project Plan: cvFlix

## 1. Initial Project Summary (Completed)

### Objective
The initial objective was to build a complete, Netflix-inspired resume portfolio. This involved replacing Supabase with a local SQLite database, implementing secure admin authentication with NextAuth.js, building out full CRUD functionality for all content sections in a dedicated admin panel, and creating a responsive, Netflix-style public interface.

### Key Accomplishments
-   **Database Migration**: Successfully migrated from Supabase to SQLite with Prisma ORM.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Implemented a secure admin panel using NextAuth.js and `bcryptjs`.
-   **Full-Featured Admin Panel**: Delivered complete CRUD functionality for Experiences, Education, Certifications, Skills, Highlights, and Appearance Customization using Ant Design.
-   **Netflix-Style Frontend**: Built the public interface using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Embla Carousel to create a responsive, dark-themed, and interactive user experience.
-   **Comprehensive Media Management**: Integrated a system for uploading and associating media with all relevant content types.

### Initial Project Status: âœ… COMPLETED
The foundational cvFlix application was successfully completed, delivering a robust and fully functional portfolio platform.

## 2. Current Project: Highlights Enhancement

Following the successful launch of the core application, the project has entered a new phase focused on transforming the "Highlights" section into a comprehensive professional experience management platform.

### Mission Statement
To evolve the highlights management system from basic text/image editing into a sophisticated showcase of professional experiences, featuring an enhanced UI/UX with floating cards and advanced media capabilities.

### Current Focus: Key Enhancements
-   **Floating Card Interface**: Implement a modern, interactive UI where clicking a highlight reveals a floating card with detailed information, shadow effects, and smooth animations.
-   **Expanded Data Model**: Enhance the `Highlight` model to include a rich `description` field, capturing detailed responsibilities and achievements for each role.
-   **Advanced Media Display**: Improve the integration and playback of both image and video content within the new floating card interface.
-   **Professional Presentation**: Move from a simple table-based admin view to a sophisticated, card-based layout that better represents professional experiences.

### Current Status: ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS
Development is actively focused on the "Highlights Enhancement" phase.

-   âœ… **Foundation**: Database schema and API endpoints have been updated to support the new `description` field.
-   ðŸŸ¡ **UI/UX Transformation**: The new floating card component (`FloatingHighlightCard.tsx`) and its corresponding click interactions are currently under development and refinement.
-   ðŸŸ¡ **Frontend Debugging**: Addressing UI functionality issues, such as the non-responsive close button on the new highlight modal, to ensure a seamless user experience.

## 3. Core Technology & Architecture

The application is built on a modern, robust technology stack:

-   **Frontend**: **Next.js 15** with **React 19** and **TypeScript**.
-   **UI (Public)**: **Tailwind CSS v4** and **Embla Carousel**.
-   **UI (Admin)**: **Ant Design v5**.
-   **Backend**: **Next.js API Routes** with the **Prisma ORM**.
-   **Database**: **SQLite**.
-   **Authentication**: **NextAuth.js v4**.

The project follows a standard Next.js app directory structure, with a clear separation between the public-facing application (`src/app`), the admin panel (`src/app/boss`), shared components (`src/components`), and backend logic (`src/app/api`).
