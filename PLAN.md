# Implementation Plan – Post v6.0.0 Release

## Release Context
- **Current version**: `v6.0.0` (Contributions & Recommended Books release)
- **Previous major**: `v5.x` Knowledge model consolidation and media upgrades
- Refer to `CHANGELOG.md` for the full release timeline and verification steps.

## Current State
- Contributions and Recommended Books stacks are live with dedicated admin pages, APIs, Prisma models, and Vitest coverage.
- Prisma schema, migrations, and seed data persist the unified `Knowledge` model alongside newly added `Contribution` and `RecommendedBook` models.
- Legacy `/api/education`, `/api/skills`, and `/api/certifications` routes remain deprecated in favour of `/api/knowledge` and `/api/upload/knowledge`.
- Admin sidebar now surfaces Knowledge, Contributions, Recommended Books, Media, and Appearance workflows.
- Homepage renders data in the order: Highlights → Portfolio → Recommended Books → Knowledge → Contributions.

## Objectives
1. Prepare `v6.1.0` enhancements focused on localization polish and homepage personalization.
2. Plan `v6.0.1` stability patch to address remaining bug fixes and analytics gaps.
3. Maintain Knowledge + Media pipelines while expanding reporting for contributions/books engagement metrics.

## Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1 – v6.0.1 Stability Patch
- **Tasks**
  - Audit API error handling for `/api/contributions` and `/api/recommended-books`; add structured error responses.
  - Extend Vitest coverage for multilingual fallbacks and empty-state UI snapshots.
  - Verify migrations on staging datasets, focusing on media connect/disconnect behaviour.
- **Commands / Checks**
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run lint`
  - Manual QA: delete/re-create contributions and books with/without media, language toggle checks.
- **Risks & Mitigations**
  - *Risk*: orphaned media links after deletions. *Mitigation*: add cleanup scripts and Prisma transactions.
  - *Risk*: inconsistent localization strings. *Mitigation*: consolidate copy in `LanguageContext` and add tests.

### Phase 2 – v6.1.0 Enhancements
- **Tasks**
  - Introduce contribution tags/categories for filtering and display on the homepage.
  - Build recommendation weighting system (priority + categories) for books carousel ordering.
  - Add analytics dashboards to `/boss` summarizing engagement metrics (views, clicks) once telemetry is in place.
- **Commands / Checks**
  - Prototype data structures in Prisma; run `npx prisma migrate dev --name v6_1_feature_prep` in a feature branch.
  - `npm run dev` for interactive QA, verifying carousel behaviour across breakpoints.
- **Risks & Mitigations**
  - *Risk*: carousel overload with new filters. *Mitigation*: lazy-load segments and enforce pagination.
  - *Risk*: analytics integration complexity. *Mitigation*: start with mock data + toggle before full rollout.

### Phase 3 – Documentation & Release Alignment
- **Tasks**
  - Keep `CHANGELOG.md` aligned with each GitHub push (ensure new entries follow `x.y.z`).
  - Update `README.md` feature list with any new sections or metrics.
  - Archive prior release plans under `/docs/` as each major version ships.
- **Commands / Checks**
  - `npm run build`
  - `npx prisma migrate deploy`
  - Proofread docs (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/*`).
- **Risks & Mitigations**
  - *Risk*: missing documentation references. *Mitigation*: incorporate doc update checklist per release.

## Dependencies & Coordination
- Confirm environments apply `v6.0.0` migrations and seeds (`npx prisma migrate deploy`).
- Coordinate with design/content teams for updated assets for contributions/books showcases.
- Ensure support/QA teams receive refreshed admin guides for Knowledge, Contributions, and Recommended Books.

## Rollback Strategy
- Preserve the last deployment snapshot prior to Knowledge rollout.
- Maintain migration SQL backups; a rollback would involve restoring the database snapshot and redeploying the pre-Knowledge build.
- Feature-flag approach: consider gating the Knowledge UI via configuration to revert to read-only mode if issues arise.

## Communication Notes
- Share the Knowledge taxonomy and new Contributions/Recommended Books capabilities with stakeholders.
- Provide admin training on multilingual workflows, media management, and the updated homepage ordering.
- Highlight API contract changes for any external consumers, especially the new `/api/contributions` and `/api/recommended-books` endpoints.
